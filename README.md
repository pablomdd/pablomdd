### Hello there...

<p align="center">
  I'm a software engineer with around 4 years of professional experience. I spent about 3 years as a frontend engineer (React JS, Next JS, Angular), and during the last year, I have worked mostly on backend engineering (Python, C#, Java), API design and microservices.</p>
  
I majored in mechatronics engineering at the Advanced Technologies School (UPIITA) of the National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico (IPN), but very early, I focused on building a software engineering career. I am a native of Ciudad del Carmen :mexico:, Mexico but I am based in Mexico City.

Some of the things I've been doing recently:

- Software Engineer Intern @Google (Corp Engineering - Austin/NYC team), late Summer 2022
- Software Engineer Intern @Microsoft (Microsoft Defender for Office - Redmond,WA), Summer 2022
- Research Assistant @ IPN's Computing Research Centre (CIC - IPN) (Robotics and Mechatronics Lab), Fall 2021
- Software Engineer Intern @Google (Google Research NYC team), Summer 2021
- Software Engineering Intern @Nowports, Spring 2021
- Explorer Fellow @MLH-Fellowship, Fall 2020.
